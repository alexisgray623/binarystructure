# Binarystructure
# This code focuses on the binary search tree. A text file of a Pokemon database is included in the binary file, and using the text file, the driver runs the executive file, which gives users a menu of 6 choices of what to do with the Pokemon data: Search, Add, Print, Copy, Remove, or Exit (the program).
# Choice 1 is "Search", which allows a user to enter an input of a choice between searching through the original or the copy Pokedex. The user then provides a pokedex number, which the program runs the search thorugh the binary search tree to see if any of the pokemon are contained within the provide text file. 
# Choice 2 is "Add", which allows a user to add a pokemon to the binary tree. The user is asked to choose whether to add the Pokemon to the original or the copy pokedex. Upon choosing, the user is then asked to input the american name, the japanese name, and the pokedex number of the pokemon. 
# Choice 3 is "Print", which prints the entire pokedex. Users are asked to choose between "pre-order", "in order", and "post order" to print, and upon entering their choice, the program will print out the Pokedex. 
# Choice 4 is "Copy", which allows users to make copy of the original Pokedex. This will only work if the user has not already created a copy. 
# Choice 5 is "Remove", which allows a user to remove a Pokemon from the orignal or the copy Pokedex. Upon choosing which one to remove from, the user is prompted to enter the id of the pokemon that they wish to remove.
# Choice 6 is "Exit", which is how the program is ended.
